# 👋 Hi, I'm Karina Kuzmina  
### Junior QA Engineer | Web & Mobile Testing | Bug Hunting  
### Learning C# Backend & Planning to Learn Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I am a beginning QA Engineer focused on **web and mobile application testing**, defect detection, and test documentation.  
I love exploring how applications work both from the user side (frontend/UI) and the internal logic (backend).

Currently I am studying **C# backend development**, and later I plan to learn **frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** to understand the full picture of how applications are built.

This helps me grow toward a future role as a **strong technical QA / QA Automation / Full-Stack QA Engineer**.
